 * Utility class that does two things: Defines the possible sizes an [AndesBadge] can take because it's an enum,
 * as you can see.
 * But as a bonus it gives you the proper implementation so you don't have to make any mapping.
 *
 * You ask me with, let's say 'STANDARD', and then I'll give you a proper implementation of that border.
 *
 * @property border Possible borders that an [AndesBadge] may take.
